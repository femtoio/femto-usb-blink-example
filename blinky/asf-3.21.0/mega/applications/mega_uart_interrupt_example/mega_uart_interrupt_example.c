 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use the megaAVR UART with interrupts.
 *
 * \section files Files:
 * - mega_uart_interrupt_example.c: megaAVR STK600 UART interrupt example
 *
 * \section exampledescription Brief description of the example application
 * This application will initialize the UART, send a string and then receive
 * it and check if it is the same string as we sent.
 *
 * \note The RX and TX pins should be externally connected in order to pass the
 * test.
