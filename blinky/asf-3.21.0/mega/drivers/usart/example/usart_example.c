/*! \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use MEGARF USART module.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - usart_example.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 * - conf_usart_example.h: configuration of the example
 *
 * \section usart_apiinfo drivers/usart API
 * The USART driver API can be found \ref megarf_usart_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR MEGARF devices can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:
 *   - STK600 with ATmega128RFA1 on STK600-RC128X_RFX. (USARTA1 should be
 * connected to the RS232 spare)
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The example waits for a received character on the configured USART and
 * echoes the character back to the same USART.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
