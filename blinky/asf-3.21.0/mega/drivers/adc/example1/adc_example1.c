 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use the \ref mega_adc_group to do a simple
 * ADC conversion.

 *
 * \section exampledescription Brief description
 * This application will read the analog value on the ADC0 pin and output the 8-bit
 * result on PORTB. in an infinite loop. If using an STK600, connect PORTB to the
 * STK600 LEDs.
 *
 * \note You must connect an analog voltage source to the ADC0 pin. If using
 * the STK600, you can use AREF0 or AREF1. Do not apply a voltage above the
 * ADC voltage reference.
 *
 * \note As the values in this example is not used for any meaningful
 * calculation we do not throw away the first reading after setting the
 * reference. You should always discard the first conversion after changing
 * the voltage reference as the reference may not yet be stable. You can find
 * more information about this in the ADC chapter of your device datasheet.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU GCC</A>
 * for AVR, and <A href="http://iar.se">IAR Embedded Workbench</A>.\n
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
