 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use the \ref mega_adc_group to set up the ADC
 * in freerunning mode.
 *
 * \section files Files:
 * - adc_example2.c: megaAVR STK600 ADC example 2
 * - adc.h: \ref mega_adc_group

 * \section exampledescription Brief description
 * This application will read the analog value on the ADC0 pin in freerunning
 * mode. An interrupt routine accumulates the readings and does an average
 * every 16 readings; storing it in a global variable.
 *
 * \note You must connect an analog voltage source to the ADC0 pin. If using
 * the STK600 you can use AREF0 or AREF1. Do not apply a voltage above the ADC
 * voltage reference.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU GCC</A>
 * for AVR, and <A href="http://iar.se">IAR Embedded Workbench</A>.\n
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
