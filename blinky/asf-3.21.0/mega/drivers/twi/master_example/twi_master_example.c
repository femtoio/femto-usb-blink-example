 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The given example uses one kit as a TWI master:
 *    - the TWI master performs a write  to the TWI slave,
 *    - the TWI master performs a read  of what it just wrote to the TWI
 *    - the read data are compared with the originally written data.
 *
 * LED gives the result of the test:
 * If PASS: LED is on at the end of the test.

/** \brief TWI Master Example Main
 *
 * The master example begins by initializing required board resources.  The
 * system clock, basic GPIO pin mapping, and interrupt vectors are established.
 *
 * A memory location on a TWI slave is written with a fixed test pattern which
 * is then read back into a separate buffer.  As a basic sanity check, the
 * original write-buffer values are compared with values read from the slave to
 * a separate buffer.  An LED on the development board is illuminated when there
 * is a match between the written and read data.
 *
 * \return Nothing.
