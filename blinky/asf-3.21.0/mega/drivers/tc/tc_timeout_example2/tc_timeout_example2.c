 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to use the \ref tc_timeout_group to implement a
 * software debounce filter on a button input.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 *  - tc_timeout_example2.c: This example application
 *  - tc_timeout.c: TC Timeout Driver implementation
 *  - tc_timeout.h: TC Timeout Driver definitions
 *  - conf_tc_timeout.h: Configuration of the TC Timeout Driver
 *
 * \section driverinfo TC Timeout Driver
 * The driver can be found \ref tc_timeout_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All megaAVR devices with a Timer/Counter module can be used.
 *
 * \section setup Setup
 * The following connections are required on STK600 for this example:
 * - For button input, connect PORTB pin header to SWITCHES pin header with a
 *   10-pin cable.
 * - For LED output, connect PORTD pin header to LEDS pin header with a 10-pin
 *   cable.
 * - For 32KHz clock, connect a wire between 32KHz and TOSC2 on the AUX pin
 *   header.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * This example will continuously sample button input from SW0 on STK600, and
 * then apply a software debounce filter to get a stable button press
 * indication. A valid button down-press will cause LED0 to toggle.
 *
 * This filter is implemented by starting a 50ms timeout on every change on the
 * button input sample. Any noise will cause the timeout to restart, but if the
 * signal is stable for a minimum of 50ms it will be considered as a valid
 * button press.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
