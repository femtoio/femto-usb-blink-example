/**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This application is a Wireless-UART using the USB CDC class (Virtual
 * Communication Port).
 * If a byte is received via the serial connection from one node, the node
 * transmits the byte to the other node. If the transmission was successful,
 * the entered bytes are forwarded to the terminal indicating successful
 * transmission.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - main.c: main file with
 *   - setup the clocks,
 *   - setup the USB
 *   - main loop.
 * - rz600.h: board configuration for the UC3 A3 MCU (SPI config).
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * This application is targeted for the UC3 A3 MCU on RZ600 boards.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
