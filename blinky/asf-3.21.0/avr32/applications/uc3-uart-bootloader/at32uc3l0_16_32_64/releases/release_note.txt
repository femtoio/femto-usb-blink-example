Release Note - AVR UC3 UART DFU ISP
___________________________________


Related deliverables:
--------------------
- this release note,
- the AVR UC3 UART Bootloader user guide,
- a binary of the bootloader (at32uc3l-uart-isp-x.y.z.bin) and a default
  configuration bin file (at32uc3l-uart-isp_cfg-x.y.z.dat) with two scripts to
  program them to UC3L (program_at32uc3l-uart-isp-x.y.z.cmd to use on a DOS
  command line and program_at32uc3l-uart-isp-x.y.z.sh to use on a unix-like
  command line).
- the ASF: bootloader source code and helper files to be
  used by applications destined to be programmed through the bootloader.

__________________

Version 1.0.1 - 2010/09/13
--------------------------
 - Fix the bootloader to support the smallest device of the AVR UC3 L0 series (i.e. AT32UC3L016).

  Supported Devices:
  ------------------
  - AVR UC3 L0 rev. D and higher.

  Devices delivered with version 1.0.1:
  ------------------------------------
  - AVR UC3 L0 rev. E, binary generated with GCC.

  Features: Same as version 1.0.0 (see below).
  --------

  Known Bugs and Limitations:
  --------------------------
  - None

  Supported Tools:
  ---------------
  - AVR32 GNU Toolchain v2.4.2
  - IAR EW AVR32 3.30
  - FLIP::batchisp 3.4.2

  Footprint information:
  ---------------------
  - AT32UC3L/IAR/: 6172 Bytes
  - AT32UC3L/GCC/: 7356 Bytes


Version 1.0.0 - 2010/03/31
--------------------------
 - First release

  Supported Devices:
  ------------------
  - AVR UC3 L0 rev. D and higher.

  Devices delivered with version 1.0.0:
  ------------------------------------
  - None

  Features:
  --------
  - same feature set as the USB DFU Bootloaders:
    – Read/Write Flash on-Chip Memories
    – Read Device ID
    – Full-Chip Erase
    – Start Application Command
  - the last two words of the Flash user page are reserved for the bootloader
  - one baudrate supported: 115200 bps
  - Automatic detection of the UART used to communicate with the external programmer.
    This detection is performed over a pre-defined set of (USART_RX, USART_TX) pairs.
    Refer to the AVR UC3 UART bootloader datasheet for the definition of the
    pre-defined set of (USART_RX, USART_TX) pairs per UC3 devices.
  - AVR UC3 L0: No external oscillator required

  Known Bugs and Limitations:
  --------------------------
  - None

  Supported Tools:
  ---------------
  - AVR32 GNU Toolchain v2.4.2
  - IAR EW AVR32 3.30
  - FLIP::batchisp 3.4.2

  Footprint information:
  ---------------------
  Note: any build with Flash footprint over 8192Bytes is not usable (because the
  bootloader is meant to fit in 8kB).
  - AT32UC3L/IAR/: 6212 Bytes
  - AT32UC3L/GCC/: 7292 Bytes
