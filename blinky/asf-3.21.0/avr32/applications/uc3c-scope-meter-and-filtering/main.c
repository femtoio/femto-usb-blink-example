/*! \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for UC3C-EK Scope Meter and Filtering demo running
 * on the UC3C_EK development kit.
 * - Step 1: Connect J34 (1-2), J35 (1-2) and J38 (3-4) headers.
 *   Turn potentiometer P1 to have the arrow vertical (It is the trigger level).
 * - Step 2: Plug a USB cable from the USB_VC connector (J27) to one of the PCæŠ¯
 *   USB ports. This provide power and USB serial communications port.
 * - Step 3: Load and run this application.
 * - Step 4: A sine wave is generated (takes part of the DAC task generation).
 * - Step 5: This signal is acquired (takes part of the ADC task acquisition).
 * - Step 6: A digital noise noise (controller by the push buttons PB0 and PB1)
 *   is then added to the signal
 * - Step 7: This noise is then filtered using a FIR filter in floating and
 *   fixed point format (takes part of the FILTER task).
 * - Step 8: All the signals are displayed on the LCD (takes part of the GUI
 *   task acquisition)
 * - Step 9: All the signals are sent to PC application (takes part of the
 *   REMOTE Task)
 * <b>Operating mode: </b>
 *   The description and the installation of the PC application, the connection
 *   of the UC3C-EK to the PC are explained in AVR32831 application note.
 *   This application note is available on www.atmel.com.

 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Information
 * All AVR32 AT32UC3C devices can be used.
 *
 * \section configinfo Configuration Information
 * This example has been tested with the following configuration:
 * - UC3C_EK evaluation kit;
 * - CPU clock: 16 MHz;
 * - USART2 (on UC3C_EK) abstracted with a USB CDC connection to a PC;
 * - PC terminal settings:
 *   - 115200 bps,
 *   - 8 data bits,
 *   - no parity bit,
 *   - 1 stop bit,
 *   - no flow control.
