 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref tc45_group to toggle LEDs.
 *
 * The example will configure TCC4 module in normal mode and use three TCC4
 * interrupts (overflow, Capture/Compare Channels A and B).
 *
 * Each callback interrupts functions are setup to toggle a LED:
 *  - LED0: Toggles on TC4 overflow interrupt
 *  - LED1: Toggle on Compare Channel A interrupt
 *  - LED2: Toggle on Compare Channel B interrupt
 *
 * The TCC4 is setup to use a 31250Hz resolution clock and a 31250 period value
 * resulting in a 1Hz TC4 overflow frequency.
 *
 * Compare Channels A and B will be setup at 1/4 and 1/2 of the TC4 period.
 * Thus, the LEDs sequence produced is LED2/LED1/LED0/LED2....
 *
 * \note
 * All AVR XMEGA E devices can be used.
 * The TC45 driver API can be found \ref tc45_group "here".
 *
 * Main files:
 *  - tc45.c Timer XMEGA Timer Counter driver implementation
 *  - tc45.h Timer XMEGA Timer Counter driver definitions
 *  - tc45_example1.c example application
 *
 * \section board_setup Board setup
 * For STK600 board:
 * - uses the RC032X routine board with TQFP32 socket
 * - PortA must be connected to LEDs
 *
 * For XMEGA-E5 Xplained board:
 * - plug USB for the power
 * - note, no LED2 on this board
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
