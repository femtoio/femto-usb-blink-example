 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref tc45_group for generation of
 * pulsed width modulation signals.
 *
 * The example configures the Timer C4 (TCC4) in waveform generator mode.
 * Waveform Extension (WeX) feature is used to output PWM signals from Compare
 * modules CCA and CCB. These complementary signals are output on Port C0/C1
 * and C2/C3. Deadtimes are inserted.
 *
 * This example is dimming the duty-cycle of the two signals in an opposite way.
 * In addition the example configures the CCA and CCB interrupts to update the
 * duty-cycle.
 *
 * Summary of Timer Counter configuration:
 *  - TCC4, Timer
 *  - Compare/Capture modules A/B, Compare and waveform generation in Dual
 *  slope mode
 *  - WeX, Deadtime Low and High insertion and override of Port C0/C1 and C2/C3.
 *
 * This example uses the on-board LEDs to provide user feedback, the output
 * from the LEDs are as follows:
 *  - LED0: fades out
 *  - LED1: fades in
 *  - LED2: fades in
 *  - LED3: fades out
 *
 * \note
 * All AVR XMEGA E devices can be used.
 * The TC45 driver API can be found \ref tc45_group "here".
 *
 * Main files:
 * - tc45.c timer/counter driver implementation
 * - tc45.h timer/counter driver definitions
 * - tc45_example3.c: tc driver example application
 *
 * \section board_setup Board setup
 * For STK600 board:
 * - uses the RC032X routine board with TQFP32 socket
 * - PC0 must be connected to LED0
 * - PC1 must be connected to LED1
 * - PC2 must be connected to LED2
 * - PC3 must be connected to LED3
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
