 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use XMEGA E USART module with Start Frame
 * Detection.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - usart_example5.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 * - conf_usart_example.h: configuration of the example
 *
 * \section usart_apiinfo drivers/usart API
 * The USART driver API can be found \ref usart_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices can be used. This example has been tested with the 
 * following setup:
 *   - STK600 with ATxmega32E5 on STK600-RC032X
 *     USARTC0 on PC2 and PC3 pins should be connected to the RXD and TXD
 *     pins of STK600 RS232 spare port.
 *   - XMEGA E5 Xplained evaluation kit
 *     USARTD0 on PORTD pin 6 and 7 is used (Connected to board controller)
 * UART configuration is 115200 baudrate, no parity, data 8 bit.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The USART is configured to encode and decode only the data fields of both the
 * received and transmit data frame.
 * The data encoding consists of a NOT operation applied on the data field of
 * the USART frame.
 *
 * To perform such data encoding, the XCL glue logic sub module is configured
 * as follow:
 *  - On the received side LUTO performs NOT operation with IN0 input and the
 * LUTO output is connected on the USART internal input
 *  - On the transmit side LUT1 performs NOT operation with internal USART
 * TX pin.
 *
 * The example outputs an encoded message then, waits for a received character
 * on the configured USART and echoes the character back to the same USART.
 * As both USART encoder and decoder are enabled, the received character is
 * encoded twice (first time during reception, the second time during
 * transmission stage) thus, the resulting character is sent back equal to the
 * orignal received character.
 *
 * The example waits for a received character on the configured USART and
 * echoes the character back to the same USART.
 *
 * Note: The example configures the USART to use together variable frame length
 * (using the PEC counter of XCL module instead of build in USART counters,
 * to count transmission data bit) and data encoding/decoding features of
 * XMEGAE USART.
 * To keep the USART communication still functionnal with a regular USART 
 * computer, the example keeps the number of data bit to be proceed equals to
 * 8bits, but it could be extended to any value up to 255 using 
 * USART_SERIAL_VARIABLE_CHAR_LENGTH.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
