/*! \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use XMEGA E USART module with variable frame
 * length.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - usart_example4.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 * - conf_usart_example.h: configuration of the example
 *
 * \section usart_apiinfo drivers/usart API
 * The USART driver API can be found \ref usart_group "here" and expecially the
 * rivers extension for XMEGA E \ref usart_xmegae_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:
 *   - STK600 with ATxmega32E5 on STK600-RC032X
 *     USARTC0 on PC2 and PC3 pins should be connected to the RXD and TXD
 *     pins of STK600 RS232 spare port.
 *   - XMEGA E5 Xplained evaluation kit
 *     USARTD0 on PORTD pin 6 and 7 is used (Link to board controller)
 * UART configuration is 115200 baudrate, no parity, data 8 bit.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The example will configure USART to use variable frame lenght feaure
 * (using the PEC counter of XCL module instead of build in USART counters,
 * to count transmission data bit). To keep the USART communication still
 * functionnal with a regular USART computer, the example configures the number
 * of data bit to be transmited to 8bits, but it could be extended to any value
 * up to 255 using USART_SERIAL_VARIABLE_CHAR_LENGTH. The example output a
 * welcome message then, waits for a received character on the configured USART
 * and echoes the character back to the same USART.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
