 /**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref crc_group by using the I/O
 * interface by using the CPU and writing the data to the DATAIN register.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - crc.c CRC driver implementation
 * - crc.h CRC driver definitions
 * - example1.c example application
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA AU/B/C devices with a CRC module can be used. This example has
 * been tested with the following setup:
 * - XMEGA-B1 Xplained
 * - XMEGA-A3BU Xplained
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 * The example will generate both CRC-32 and CRC-16 for a data buffer, append
 * the checksums to the data, generate new checksums and check that these are
 * zero. Leds will light up if this is the case.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following modules:
 * - \ref crc_group
 * - \ref gpio_group for LED output
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
 *
