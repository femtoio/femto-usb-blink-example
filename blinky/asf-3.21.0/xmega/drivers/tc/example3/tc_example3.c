 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref tc_group for generation of
 * pulsed width modulation signals.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - tc.c timer/counter driver implementation
 * - tc.h timer/counter driver definitions
 * - tc_example3.c: tc driver example application
 * - conf_tc.h: configuration of the tc driver
 *
 * \section apiinfo tc driver API
 * The tc driver API can be found \ref tc_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices with tc and awex modules can be used.
 *
 * \section example_description Description of the example
 * The example will configure the Timer E0 (TCE0) in waveform generator mode.
 * AWex is used to output PWM signals from Compare modules CCA and CCB.
 * These complementary signals are output on Port E0 and E1. Deadtimes are
 * inserted. This example is dimming the duty-cycle of the two signals in an
 * opposite way.
 *
 * In addition the example configures the CCA and CCB interrupts to update the
 * duty-cycle
 *
 * Summary of Timer Counter configuration:
 *  - TCE0 : Timer
 *  - Compare/Capture modules A/B : Compare and waveform generation in Dual
 *  slope mode
 *  - AXexE : Deadtime Low and High insertion and override of Port E0/E1
 *
 * This example uses the on-board LEDs to provide user feedback, the output
 * from the LEDs are as follows:
 *  - LED0: fades out
 *  - LED1: fades in

 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
