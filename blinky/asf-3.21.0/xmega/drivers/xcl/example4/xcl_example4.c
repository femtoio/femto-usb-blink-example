 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use XMEGA E XCL module with LUT sub-module.
 * It performs a logic XOR operation between the 3 external input pins.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - xcl_example4.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 *
 * \section xcl_apiinfo drivers/XCL API
 * The XCL driver API can be found \ref xcl_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA E devices can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:
 *   - STK600 with ATxmega32E5 on STK600-RC032X.
 *     LED0 pin should be connected to PD4 pin
 *     SW0 pin should be connected to PD1 pin
 *     SW1 pin should be connected to PD2 pin
 *     SW2 pin should be connected to PD3 pin
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * This example configures XCL LUT sub-module LUT0/LUT1 in one 3 inputs LUT to
 * perform a logic XOR operation between the 3 external inputs pins IN0/IN2/IN3
 * map on the low nible of PORTD (respectively PD2, PD1 and PD3).
 * The LUTO output pin is mapped to PORTD pin4.
 * As this XCL configuration is purely asynchronous, the example enters Power
 * Down sleep mode, but the XOR operation between the three pins is still
 * functionnal.

 *
 * \section stk600_setup Setup for STK600 and RC032x
 * As a result, LED0 will light when only one SW0 or SW1 or SW2 push button is
 * pressed.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
