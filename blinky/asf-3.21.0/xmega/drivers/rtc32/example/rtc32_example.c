 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref rtc32_group.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 *  - rtc32.c RTC32 driver implementation
 *  - rtc32.h RTC32 driver definitions
 *  - rtc32_example.c example application
 *  - conf_rtc32.h RTC32 driver configurations
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 *  All AVR XMEGA devices with a RTC32 can be used. This example have been
 *  tested with the following setup:
 *  - STK600 and RC064X/TQFP64 with ATxmega256A3B
 *
 * \section setup Setup
 * The following setup is required on STK600:
 * - On connector AUX: Connect 32KHz to TOSC2 in order to have a clock source
 * for the RTC32
 * - For LED output: Connect full LEDS connector to PORTD
 *
 * Optional:
 * - For keeping RTC32 running between reset connect PF5 (VBAT) to VTG. Or to
 * have it running RTC32 on missing VTG connect PF5 to a external power source.
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 * The example will initalize the RTC32 and use the STK600 LEDS to show the
 * last two digits from time in binary coded decimal (BCD).
 *
 * Due to the nature of the RTC32; alarms can't be given faster than every third
 * RTC32 clock cycle. And with a RTC32 clock cycle of 1Hz the LEDS will only
 * update every third second.
 *
 * Since the RTC32 is battery backed up it can keep track of it's time in the
 * case of reset or power off. See \ref setup for details on this.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following modules:
 * - \ref rtc32_group
 * - \ref gpio_group for LED output
 * - \ref pmic_group for interrupt handling
 * - \ref sleepmgr_group for sleep management
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
