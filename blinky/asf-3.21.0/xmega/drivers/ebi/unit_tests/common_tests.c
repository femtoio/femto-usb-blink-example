/**
 * \brief Test the data bus
 *
 * Tests the data bus for stuck and coupled lines by writing and verifying bit
 * patterns in RAM.
 *
 * First, unique 32-bit patterns with a single set bit are written to successive
 * locations in memory. These patterns are referred to as a walking 1 since the
 * bit pattern is shifted by 1 position for each new memory location.
 *
 * The patterns are then read back for verification, inverted and written back
 * to the memory location -- the memory locations now contain a walking 0. These
 * patterns are read back again for verification.
 *
 * \param test Current test case.

 *
 * The first test of the address bus is for lines that are stuck high. This is
 * done by writing the value 0xAA to the base, then verifying that all
 * power-of-two locations still contain 0x55.
 *
 * The address bus is then checked for lines that are stuck low or coupled. The
 * base location is reinitialized with the value 0x55 before this test. The
 * value 0xAA is then temporarily written to the individual power-of-two
 * locations while the content of the others (base and power-of-two) are
 * verified to still contain 0x55.
