 /**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to use the \ref pwm_group with interrupts.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - pwm.c PWM service implementation
 * - pwm.h PWM service definitions
 * - example2.c example application
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * This example is made specifically for XMEGA-A1 Xplained. However, any XMEGA
 * board with LEDs connected to PE0 and PE4 may be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * This example uses two PWM channels on two different LEDs. An interrupt is
 * triggered on each PWM TC overrun, and the interrupt handler will increase
 * the duty cycle of the PWM channels, thus fading the LEDs out (since the LEDs
 * are active low, increased duty cycle means more dimmed light).
 * The two PWM channels are running two different frequencies to make the
 * fading speed different.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following module:
 * - \ref pwm_group
 *
 * \section apiinfo PWM Service API
 * The PWM service API can be found \ref pwm_group "here"
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
 *
 * \section contactinfo Contact Information
