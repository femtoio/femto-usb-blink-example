 * \brief This is the RTC compare interrupt.
 *
 * Actions required in Class B tests are implemented as callbacks. Note that
 * this requires a number of symbols to be defined, either in a header file or
 * at the compiler level.
 *
 * It is possible to add user-defined code to the RTC interrupt through
 * \ref CLASSB_ACTIONS_RTC().
 *
 * \param time Time parameter passed by RTC driver. Unused here.
