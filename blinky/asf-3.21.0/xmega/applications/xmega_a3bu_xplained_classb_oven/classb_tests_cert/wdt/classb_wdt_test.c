/**
 * \brief Perform self-diagnostic test of watchdog timer (WDT).
 *
 * Basically this functions tests the following:
 * -# that WDT issues a system reset after timeout.
 * -# the WDT timing and that it can be reset.
 * -# that WDT issues a system reset if it is untimely reset in window mode.
 *
 * If any of these tests fail, \ref CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_WDT() is called.
 * By default the device will then simply hang.
 *
 * The expected (error-free) execution flow is as follows:
 * -# Power-on or external reset has occurred.
 * -# Check that WDT can issue a system reset. Set test state 1 then issue a
 * system reset.
 * -# Check that WDT can be reset. Set test state 2 then issue a system reset.
 * -# Check that window mode works correctly. Set test state 3 then issue a
 * system reset.
 * -# Set up WDT according to settings, i.e., CLASSB_ACTIONS_1_WDT(). Set test
 * state "ok" and continue to main().
 *
 * The reset cause is used to decide which actions to take. The user can
 * configure how to process a reset caused by the watchdog when the test is in
 * the "ok" state, i.e., \ref CLASSB_ACTIONS_2_WDT(), or what to do for
 * brown-out or software reset, i.e., \ref CLASSB_ACTIONS_3_WDT().
 *
 * The real time counter (RTC) is used as an independent clock source, which is
 * necessary for checking the timing of the oscillator used by the WDT.
 *
 * \note This test is executed before the main function. The method to achieve
 * this depends on the specific compiler that is used.
