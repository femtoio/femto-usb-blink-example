/**
 * \defgroup classb_registers CPU Register test
 *
 * \brief This is the self-test module for the registers in the CPU.
 *
 * The CPU registers are tested for stuck bits and some coupling faults.
 * The test is executed by calling \ref classb_register_test(). The test
 * procedure consists of five steps per register:
 *  -# Write 0x55 to register
 *  -# Write 0xAA to register
 *  -# Verify content (0xAA) of register
 *  -# Write 0x55 to register
 *  -# Verify content (0x55) of register
 *
 * Non-destructive testing is done on the R-registers that are stated to
 * need preservation in the compiler documentation and on all IO registers.
 * Further, this test returns its result using a register. Therefore, the
 * register used to return the value, the stack pointer registers or those
 * used within the test (e.g. to save values) are critical in the sense
 * that the test cannot be executed correctly unless these registers are
 * working.
 *
 * The error handler for the test is \ref CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_REGISTERS().
 * It is possible to configure independently the behavior of the test with
 * respect to failure in critical and non-critical registers (see
 * \ref CLASSB_ERROR_CRIT and \ref CLASSB_ERROR_NON_CRIT).
 *
 * Given that GCC and IAR make use of the CPU registers in a different manner,
 * we have included a compiler-specific function. This reduces execution time
 * and simplifies the code.
 *
 * \note Interrupts must be disabled during this test.

/**
 * \defgroup settings_cpu Settings related to error handling
 *
 * \brief Symbols to define behavior upon detected register faults.
 *
 * In principle, any error in critical registers would mean that the system
 * cannot verify whether the registers are working correctly. Since registers
 * are vital to most applications, the microcontroller should probably hang.
 *
 * However, this behavior can be modified so that failure in critical registers
 * is handled by \ref CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_REGISTERS(). The behavior for failure
 * in non-critical registers can also be configured: the microcontroller can
 * call the error handler or hang.
