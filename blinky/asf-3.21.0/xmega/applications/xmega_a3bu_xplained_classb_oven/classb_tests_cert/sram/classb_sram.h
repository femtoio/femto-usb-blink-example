/**
 * \defgroup classb_sram Internal SRAM Test
 *
 * \brief Self-diagnostic test for coupling faults in internal SRAM memory
 *
 * The test \ref classb_sram_test() divides the internal SRAM into
 * \ref CLASSB_NSECS sections that are tested in turns with a March algorithm
 * (see \ref marchx). The simplest behavior of the test is when there is no
 * overlap between memory sections. In this case all sections have the same
 * size, except possibly the last one (see \ref CLASSB_NSECS). The first memory
 * section (referred to as the buffer) is reserved: it is used by the test to
 * store the content of the other sections while they are being tested (for more
 * details see \ref classb_buffer).
 *
 * If there is overlap (see \ref CLASSB_OVERLAP), every time a memory section is
 * tested, a part of the previous section is tested as well. Note that this does
 * not apply to the buffer, since it is the first section. The size of the
 * buffer is then expanded with respect to the previous case. Further, the size
 * of the second section is decreased correspondingly.
 *
 * If there should be an error in internal SRAM the error handler
 * \ref CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_SRAM() would be called.
 *
 * \attention Interrupts must be disabled during this test.
 *
 * \section marchx March X
 *
 * The chosen algorithm is <em>March X</em>. This consists on the following
 * steps:
 * \f[
       \Updownarrow ( w_\mathbf{D} ) ;
       \Uparrow ( r_\mathbf{D} , w_{\bar{\mathbf{D}}} );
       \Downarrow ( r_{\bar{\mathbf{D}}} , w_\mathbf{D} );
       \Updownarrow ( r_\mathbf{D} ) \; ,
 * \f]
 * where \f$w\f$ denotes a write operation, \f$r\f$ denotes a read operation,
 * \f$\mathbf{D}\f$ is any data background, \f$\bar{\mathbf{D}}\f$ is the
 * complement of \f$\mathbf{D}\f$ and the arrows refer to the addressing order.
 * In our implementation we have chosen \f$\mathbf{D} = \textnormal{0x00}\f$.
 *
 * Under the restricted coupling faults (CFs) model, the interleaved
 * organization of the memory in XMEGA avoids any kind of intra-word CFs.
 * However, in order to detect some intra-word CFs that are not considered by
 * this fault model, we have included the following optional march element:
 * \f[
       \Updownarrow ( w_\mathbf{D_0} , r_\mathbf{D_0} ,
               \ldots , w_\mathbf{D_d} , r_\mathbf{D_d}) \; ,
 * \f]
 * where the background sequence is \f$ \textnormal{0x00, 0xFF, 0x55, 0xAA,
 * 0x33, 0xCC, 0x0F, 0xF0} \f$. This intra-word test is only executed if
 * \ref CLASSB_SRAM_INTRAWORD_TEST is defined. The elements that correspond to
 * the first two data backgrounds are redundant because the first part of the
 * test includes them. This optional test will detect all intra-word state CFs
 * considered by the unrestricted CF model.
