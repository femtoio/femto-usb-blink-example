/**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * This application demonstrates the use of Atmel's certified Class B-test
 * algorithms for XMEGA in a simulation of an induction oven on an XMEGA-A3BU
 * Xplained board.
 *
 * For more information about class B compliance with XMEGA and the certified
 * test code, please refer to the application note "AVR1610: Guide to IEC 60730
 * Class B Compliance with XMEGA".
 *
 * \note To operate this demo, it is necessary to mount jumpers between pins
 * ADC2-ADC4 on header J2 and pins RXD-SS on header J1 of the XMEGA-A3BU
 * Xplained.
 *
 * \anchor how_to_enable_crc_test
 * \note The Flash CRC test is commented out in \ref oven_classb_run_tests() in
 * \ref oven_classb.c because the result depends on the compiled code, i.e., it
 * is affected by changes in the toolchain and project settings.
 * To use the test, a precalculated CRC must be retrieved by setting a
 * breakpoint in the function after \c checksum_test_flash is assigned, and its
 * content then copied into \c classb_precalculated_flash_crc, which is stored
 * in EEPROM. Recompile and reprogram the project, and the test will check
 * against the correct value.
 *
 * The application consists of several elements:
 * - The ASF framework: Used for device setup, graphical presentation and use of
 *   the Timer/Counter, ADC and DAC modules
 * - The Class B tests: The certified tests are distributed with the application
 *   note AVR1610
 *     - \ref tests_page
 *     - \ref classb_modules
 * - The oven application consisting of
 *     - main.c: The main function, with initialization and work loop.
 *     - oven_plant.c: A simple discrete model of heat transfer between a plate,
 *     a pot with water and the environment
 *     - oven_controller.c: Emulates the control logic of a real oven
 *     - oven_ui.c: Controls the user interface, draws graphics, reads button
 *     states.
 *     - oven_classb.c: Initialization and execution of Class B tests. Provides
 *     an error test-bench which can induce errors on the device to verify that
 *     the tests catch the errors they are designed to catch.
 *     - oven.h: Application timer module selection and global constants. If the
 *     WDT periods are changed in classb_wdt.h, the watchdog reset period must
 *     be updated in this file to reflect the changes.
 *
 * The Class B tests are set up at the start of the oven_application process,
 * and are called by the oven controller when the user "turns on" the simulated
 * oven by pressing SW1.
 *
 * When power is turned on, indicated by a power bar, some tests are performed
 * periodically.
 *
 * \section operation How to operate the application
 *
 * When running, the controller and simulation plant communicate through two
 * interfaces, DAC to ADC to simulate a temperature sensor, and frequency
 * generation and -capture to simulate the signal an induction cooker
 * would send to the induction elements.
 *
 * The control path is outlined below.
 *
 * \dot
   digraph clock_example {
       UI [label = "User interface"];
       CTL [label = "Oven controller"];
       SIM [label = "Simulation plant"];

       UI -> CTL [label = "Power level"];
       CTL -> SIM [label = "Freq signal"];
       SIM -> UI [label = "ADC reading"];
       SIM -> CTL [label = "ADC reading"];
   }
 * \enddot
 *
 * \section using Using the application.
 *
 * When the oven application is running, the display shows a continuously
 * updated graph of the pot temperature (1) and plate temperature (2), together
 * with an icon that indicates whether the pot is on or off the plate (3) and a
 * bar that visualizes the applied power (4), as exemplified in this screen
 * capture:
 * \image html class_b_demo.png
 * \image latex class_b_demo.png
 *
 * To turn on the power and cycle between the power levels, the user can press
 * SW1 on the upper right hand of the evaluation board. To simulate that a pot
 * is placed on the plate, the user can touch the QTouch button QTB0 on the
 * lower left hand of the board.
 *
 * \section errors Inducing errors in the application
 *
 * By pressing the upper left key, marked SW0, the user enters a menu, allowing
 * the user to choose an error to induce by pressing the Up/Down buttons and
 * selecting with the QTouch button.
 *
 * To recover from an induced error, the device must be reset. This can be done
 * by cycling power on the board or resetting the device via debugger.
 *
 * The entries in the error induction menu are:
 * - Change clock frequency: Changes the peripheral clock divider, simulating
 *   that the clock system has malfunctioned. This should be detected by the
 *   Class B frequency consistency test.
 *
 * - Mess with test timer: Changes how often periodic tests are performed,
 *   simulating an error with an interrupt timer. This should be detected by the
 *   Class B interrupt monitor.
 *
 * - Change a Flash section: Changes the string for the menu title stored in
 *   program memory to "Out of cheese", simulating Flash memory corruption.
 *   This can be changed back by selecting the menu item again. This should be
 *   detected by the Class B Flash CRC test, \ref how_to_enable_crc_test
 *   "if it has been enabled".
 *
 * - Scramble SRAM section: Starts a continuous DMA transfer in the background to
 *   a memory location, simulating transient SRAM corruption. This should be
 *   detected by the Class B SRAM test.
 *
 * - Change ADC reference: Enables an interrupt that will change the ADC voltage
 *   reference after the first successful conversion. This will result in an
 *   unexpected ADC reading being caught in the Analog IO plausibility check
 *   which is run when the "oven" is turned on by pressing the SW1-button on the
 *   board.
 *
 * - Enter infinite loop: Simulates a runaway program counter by looping
 *   forever. This should be detected by the watchdog timer system which is
 *   tested on device power-up.
 *
 * Last, an error can be induced by removing the jumper between ADC2 and ADC4
 * on the J2 header on the XMEGA-A3BU Xplained board.
