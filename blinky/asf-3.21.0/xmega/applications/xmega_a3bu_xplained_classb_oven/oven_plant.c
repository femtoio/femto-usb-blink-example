/**
 * \brief Perform a simulation step.
 *
 * This function first reads the received frequency signal representing the
 * power level the plate element is actuated with, then performs a simulation
 * step and outputs the simulated temperature of the plate element as an analog
 * value via DACB on the pin marked ADC2.
 *
 * The simulation plant is a discretized version of the continuous system:
 * \f$ \dot{x} = \mathbf{F}*\vec{x} + \mathbf{B}*\vec{u} \f$, where:
 * \f[
   \begin{array}{c}
   \mathbf{F} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c}
           \frac{-1}{C_\textnormal{plate} * K_\textnormal{plate}} & 0 \\
	   \\
	   0 & \frac{-1}{C_\textnormal{pot} * K_\textnormal{pot}}
       \end{array} \right] \\
   \vec{x} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}
           E_\textnormal{plate} \\
	   \\
	   E_\textnormal{pot}
       \end{array} \right] \\
   \mathbf{B} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c}
           1 & 0 \\
	   \\
	   0 & 1
       \end{array} \right] \\
   \vec{u} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}
           \frac{T_\textnormal{environment}}{K_\textnormal{plate}} \\

       \end{array} \right]
   \end{array} \\
   \f]
 * in the case when the pot is OFF the plate.
 *
 * This corresponds to the plate and the pot cooling separately by Newton's law
 * of cooling because no power can be induced when the pot is not on the plate.
 *
 * When the pot is ON the stove, the system is similar, but \b F is modified by
 * adding heat transfer between the plate and the contents of the pot, and
 * disregarding heat loss from the plate to the environment.
 * Likewise \b u is modified by adding energy induction into the bottom of the
 * pot, simplified here as being the same point as the plate:
 * \f[
   \begin{array}{c}
   \mathbf{F} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c}
           \frac{-1}{C_\textnormal{plate}* K_\textnormal{plate}} &
	   		\frac{1}{C_\textnormal{pot}* K_\textnormal{plate}} \\
	   \\
           \frac{1}{C_\textnormal{plate}* K_\textnormal{plate}} &
	   		\frac{-1}{C_\textnormal{pot}* K_\textnormal{plate}}
                   - \frac{1}{C_\textnormal{pot} * K_\textnormal{pot}}
	\end{array} \right] \\

           \delta E_\textnormal{induced} \\
