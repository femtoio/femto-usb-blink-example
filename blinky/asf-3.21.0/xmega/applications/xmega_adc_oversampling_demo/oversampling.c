 * \section intro Introduction
 *  This Projects demonstrates:\n
 *  - How to implement oversampling application with XMEGA ADC : \n
 *    The oversampling is used to increase the resolution of ADC hardware by
 *    implementing signal processing in firmware.
 *    In this example,configuration has been selected to increase
 *    resolution from 12 bit signed to 16 bit signed
 *  - More information can be obtained from application note
 *	  "Atmel AVR1629: XMEGA ADC Oversampling"

 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA device. This example have been tested with following setup:
 * - XMEGA-A3BU Xplained
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 *
 * - All configurations related to oversampling level, ADC input pin, reference
 *   voltages, reference source and gain error factor are available from
 *   conf_oversampling.h file.
 * - To calculate a single result, this demo application will use number of
 *   sample as per configuration and perform signal processing to get higher
 *   resolution ADC result.
 * - After oversampling process, the converted analog input voltage and also
 *   ADC counts are displayed on LCD available in XMEGA-A3BU Xplained kit.
 * - Also, for comparison purpose, analog input voltage is calculated with only
 *   one sample(i.e. without oversampling) and this analog input voltage and
 *   corresponding ADC counts are displayed on LCD.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
