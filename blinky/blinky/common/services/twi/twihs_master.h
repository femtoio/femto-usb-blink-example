/**

 * \defgroup twihs_group Two Wire-interface High Speed(TWIHS)
 *
 * This is the common API for TWIHS. Additional features are available
 * in the documentation of the specific modules.
 *
 * See \ref twihs_quickstart.
 *
 * \section twihs_group_platform Platform Dependencies
 *
 * The TWIHS API is partially chip- or platform-specific. While all
 * platforms provide mostly the same functionality, there are some
 * variations around how different bus types and clock tree structures
 * are handled.
 *
 * The following functions are available on all platforms, but there may
 * be variations in the function signature (i.e. parameters) and
 * behaviour. These functions are typically called by platform-specific
 * parts of drivers, and applications that aren't intended to be
 * portable:
 *   - Master TWIHS Module initialization
 *   \code status_code_t twihs_master_setup(*twihs_module_pointer, twihs_master_options_t *opt) \endcode
 *   - Enables TWIHS Module
 *   \code void twihs_master_enable(*twihs_module_pointer) \endcode
 *   - Disables TWIHS Module
 *   \code void twihs_master_disable(*twihs_module_pointer) \endcode
 *   - Read data from a slave device
 *   \code status_code_t twihs_master_read(*twihs_module_pointer, twihs_package_t *package) \endcode
 *   - Write data from to a slave device
 *   \code status_code_t twihs_master_write(*twihs_module_pointer, twihs_package_t *package) \endcode
