 * \section board STK600 development board
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use the avr libc utility setbaud to find
 * the correct settings for the UART baudrate registers.
 *
 * \section files Files:
 * - mega_setbaud_example.c: megaAVR STK600 setbaud example application
 *
 * \section exampledescription Brief description of the example application
 * This application will set up the UART according to the settings in the
 * conf_uart.h file, baudrate is calculated using the avr libc setbaud utility.
 * When initialization of the UART is done the application sends the letter 'A'
 * on the UART and expect to receive the same letter, hence the hardware must
 * be set up so that the TX and RX pin is shorted to create a loop back.
 *
 * The util/setbaud tool is a tool offered by the avr libc library, and is
 * a function for compile time calculation of the baudrate register of values.
 * In application where run-time baudrate change is not needed this is a tool
 * which easily calculates the best baudrate register settings while keeping the
 * flash footprint at a minimum.
 *
 * A common way of using the setbaud tool is:
 * \code
	 // Define the CPU clock frequency, e.g. 1MHz
	 #define F_CPU 1000000UL
	 // Define the target baudrate, e.g. 9600bps
	 #define BAUD 9600
	 // Set the accepted tolerance, e.g. 2%
	 #define BAUD_TOL 2

	 // Load the calculated values into the correct registers
	 UBRR0H = UBRRH_VALUE;
	 UBRR0L = UBRRL_VALUE;

	 //Then we need to take into account that we may need to set the 2X bit in
	 //the UART control register to achieve the correct baudrate.
	 #ifdef USE_2X
	 UCSR0A |= (1 << U2X0);
	 #endif

	 // The last thing that needs to be done is to enable output on the TX pin,
	 // input on the RX pin and enable the RX and TX in the UART itself. In
	 // addition to setting the correct mode and bit length, parity and stop-bits.
\endcode
