 * \section board STK600 development board
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to set up correct clock settings for
 * the megaAVR devices. The goal of this example is to use the libc delay
 * functions.
 *
 * \section files Files:
 * - mega_clock_example.c: megaAVR STK600 clock example application
 *
 * \section exampledescription Brief description of the example application
 * The example application set up the correct clock setting to use the
 * libc delay functions. The only thing this application will do is to
 * demonstrate how to call the libc delay functions. There are no output
 * in form of leds. To verify operation of this example it is recommended
 * to use debugging and break on different lines.
 *
 * \note Optimization <i>must</i> to be enabled for the delay functions to work correctly,
 * please refer to
 * <A href="http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__util__delay.html">libc</A>
 * for more information.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU GCC</A>
 * for AVR. \n
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
