 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref macsc_group to use the MAC
 * Symbol counter to implement a sleep-wakeup scheme
 * suitable for beacon-enabled IEEE802.15.4 networks.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 *  - macsc_megarf.c MAC Symbol Counter driver implementation
 *  - macsc_megarf.h MAC Symbol Counter driver definitions
 *  - macsc_megarf_example2.c example application
 *  - conf_example.h: configuration of the example
 *
 * \section driverinfo MACSC Driver
 * The MACSC driver can be found \ref macsc_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All megaRF devices with an MACSC can be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * This example will prepare the MACSC to use the relative compare mode to
 * remain awake during the
 * Contention Access Period(CAP) and required GTS of the superframe and sleep
 * during the sleep period.
 * All 3 compare modules are used along with Beacon Timestamp register.
 * Ideally,Beacon Timestamp register is updated with SCCNT value when an
 * EEE802.15.4 frame is received(automatic Time stamping feature).
 * However,this application simulates the scenario by enabling manual write of
 * the Beacon Timestamp register to demonstrate relative compare.
 *
 * Power-save sleep mode of the MCU is used in the application.
 * The beacon time-stamp is captured whenever a compare 3 interrupt occurs.This
 * simulates the Beacon Interval(BEACON_INTERVAL in conf_example.h)
 * Compare 1 interrupt occurs with respect to the value in Beacon timestamp
 * register- relative compare mode.This simulates the active period of the
 * superframe(ACTIVE_PERIOD in conf_example.h)
 * Compare 2 interrupt occurs with respect to the value in Beacon timestamp
 * register- relative compare mode.This simulates the sleep period of the
 * superframe(SLEEP_PERIOD in conf_example.h)
 *
 * Action taken on occurence of interrupt callbacks
 *  - Compare 3 callback:CMP3_INT_CHK_PIN toggle.CMP2_INT_CHK_PIN set high.
 * End of Beacon Interval.Relative compare for active period on cmp 1 is started.
 *
 *  - Compare 1 callback:End of active period of superframe.Relative
 * compare for sleep period on compare 2 is started.Put system to sleep.
 *
 *  - Compare 2 callback:CMP2_INT_CHK_PIN set low.
 * End of sleep period of superframe.Sleep is disabled.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
