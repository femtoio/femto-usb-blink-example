 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example calculates the AVCC voltage by measuring the internal bandgap
 * voltage.

 * - adc_example3.c: megaAVR ADC example 3
 * - adc.h: \ref mega_adc_group
 *
 * \section exampledescription Brief description
 * This application will measure the internal bandgap voltage using AVCC as
 * the reference and then calculate AVCC based on the measurement.
 * Add the supply_voltage variable to your watch window to observe the
 * calculated value. To save size and speed the calculation is done with integer
 * math and not floating point. The resulting value is in millivolts.

 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU GCC</A>
 * for AVR, and <A href="http://iar.se">IAR Embedded Workbench</A>.\n
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
