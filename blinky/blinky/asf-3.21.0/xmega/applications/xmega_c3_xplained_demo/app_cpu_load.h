 * The CPU load task monitors the CPU active time and CPU sleep time through a
 * TC counter. The counter is saved and reseted when the CPU enters and exits
 * of the sleep mode. Each 250ms, the ratio is displayed through a bargraph on
 * the OLED display. The implementation is available in app_cpu_load.c/.h files.
