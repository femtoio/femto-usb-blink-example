/**
 * \brief Buffer for temporary storage of SRAM sections during test.
 *
 * This buffer is placed in the beginning of SRAM, and its size in Bytes should
 * be (\c INTERNAL_SRAM_SIZE / \c CLASSB_NSECS) + \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE.
 *
 * As an example, let us suppose the device has \c INTERNAL_SRAM_SIZE = 4096
 * Bytes of SRAM, \ref CLASSB_NSECS = 8 and \ref CLASSB_OVERLAP = 25.
 * Since the number of sections is a divisor of \c INTERNAL_SRAM_SIZE, there
 * would be exactly 8 sections, each with a size of 512 Bytes. With 25% overlap,
 * we need to extend the first section (the buffer) by 128 Bytes, and the second
 * section is shortened accordingly. Therefore, we would have to reserve
 * 512 + 128 = 640 Bytes for the buffer.
 *
 * Refer to the compiler's device header file for \c INTERNAL_SRAM_START and
 * \c INTERNAL_SRAM_SIZE.
 *
 * The implementation depends on the compiler:\n
 * For IAR it is easy because variables can be placed in a specific address
 * using the location pragma directive.\n
 * For GCC the following steps should be followed:
 * - First, it is necessary to define in <em>AVR/GNU C linker > Memory settings
 * </em> a section that starts at \c INTERNAL_SRAM_START, for example:\n
 * \code .classb_sram_buffer=0x2000 \endcode
 * - Second, the buffer variable has to be placed in that memory section. This
 * can be done by appending this to the definition of the variable:\n
 * \code __attribute__ ((section(".classb_sram_buffer"))) \endcode
 * - Third, the <tt>.data</tt> section has to be moved so that there is no
 * overlap, i.e., the start should be \c INTERNAL_SRAM_START + the buffer size.
 * Continuing on the earlier example, we get a buffer size of 640 = 0x280, so
 * we would need to set:\n
 * \code .data=0x2280 \endcode

/**
 * \brief Execute March X test on one memory section at a time.
 *
 * This function keeps track of which section to test, and tests them in order.
 *
 * The test behaves as follows for a general section:
 * - The size of the section is \c CLASSB_SEC_SIZE.
 * - In order to have overlap between sections, the total number of bytes to be
 * tested must be \c CLASSB_SEC_SIZE + \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE.
 * - The algorithm is set to start \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE bytes before the start
 * of the current section, thus overlapping \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE bytes with
 * the previous section.
 *
 * Special cases of memory sections are:
 * - The first section to test is the buffer segment, which starts at
 * \c INTERNAL_SRAM_START and is of size \c CLASSB_SEC_SIZE +
 * \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE. In this case there is no previous segment, so no
 * overlap is necessary. The total number of bytes to test is then the size of
 * the buffer.
 * - The second section to test is the first "data" memory section, i.e., the
 * one after the buffer). The size of this section is \c CLASSB_SEC_SIZE -
 * \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE: the size of this section was reduced by
 * \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE bytes in order to expand the buffer by the same number
 * of bytes. The test starts \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE bytes before the beginning
 * of the section, and * the total number of bytes tested is then
 * \c CLASSB_SEC_SIZE.
 * - The "remainder" segment, if any. This section has a size of
 * \c CLASSB_SEC_REM, so the total number of bytes to test will be
 * \c CLASSB_SEC_REM + \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE.

/**
 * \brief Run March X algorithm on specified memory range.
 *
 * The following steps are followed:
 * -# The content of the area to be tested is copied to the buffer. This does
 * not apply when the buffer is tested.
 * -# The March X algorithm is applied to the section to test for coupling
 * faults.
 * -# Memory content is copied back from the buffer. This does not apply when
 * the buffer is tested.
 *
 * This function requires that all variables are placed in registers by the
 * compiler. This is achieved by using the \c register specifier (probably not
 * necessary if the right level of optimization is chosen).
 *
 * If there should be an error in SRAM a local variable (implemented in a
 * register) would be flagged. This would lead to the error handler \ref
 * CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_SRAM() being called.
