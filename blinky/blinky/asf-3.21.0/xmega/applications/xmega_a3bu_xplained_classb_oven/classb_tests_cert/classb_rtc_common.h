/**
 * \defgroup rtc_driver Real Time Counter Driver
 *
 * \brief This is a basic driver for the Real Time Counter (RTC).
 *
 * The RTC is used to generate interrupts periodically for both the CPU
 * frequency and the interrupt self-diagnostic routines. Depending on the
 * specific device, an RTC or an RTC32 will be used. In both cases the RTC is
 * clocked independently from the CPU with a 32.768 kHz oscillator scaled down
 * to 1024 Hz.
 *
 * The interrupt period can be configured in the driver through
 * \ref CLASSB_RTC_INT_PERIOD. Further, the RTC module is setup with
 * \ref classb_rtc_setup(). Note that interrupts should be enabled in the main
 * application with \c sei().
 *
 * Note that it is possible to use a different RTC driver. The only requirement
 * is that it defines the constants for the interrupt period
 * \ref CLASSB_RTC_INT_PERIOD and the RTC frequency \ref CLASSB_RTC_FREQ.
 *
 * @{

/**
 * \name RTC Settings and Class B Interface.
 *
 * These two constants give information about the RTC to the Class B tests.
 * Therefore, they need to be defined with correct values. As long as these are
 * defined, any RTC driver can be used.
 *
 * @{
 */

/**
 * \brief RTC interrupt period.
 *
 * This constant is used to configure the period of the RTC compare interrupt.
 * In addition, it is used in the Class B tests. An example value is \c 2048UL.
 *
 * \note This is a 16- or 32-bit value depending on the RTC hardware module.
