 * \section intro Introduction
 *  XMEGA E provides a feature that RTC peripheral can do an internal
 *  correction on the RTC clock by taking the PPM error value from
 *  the CALIB Register : \n
 *  Prior to this user has to find calibration value in PPM and same
 *  has to be loaded in CALIB register : \n
 *  This example project explains how to calibrate the RTC clock source by
 *  by using an external accurate clock source.The calculated calibration value
 *  will be stored in EEPROM location. Later, user application code has to
 *  read this calibration value from EEPROM and load in CALIB register.

 * \section device_info Device Info
 *  AVR XMEGA E device. This example have been tested with following setup:
 * - STK600-ATXmega32E5
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 *
 * - All configurations related such as system clock value, EEPROM location
 *   to store calibration value are available from conf_rtc_calibration.h
 * - To calculate the RTC clock error in ppm, it uses an accurate external
 *   clock which used as system clock.By using TC4,TC5 and event channels along
 *   with external clock, RTC clock error in ppm will be calculated.
 * - The calculated calibration value will be stored in EEPROM location
 * - Also the status of calibration will be stored in EEPROM,success or failure.
 * - Later, user application code has to read this calibration value from
 *   EEPROM and load in CALIB register, if status of calibration is success.
