 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref tc_group to toggle LEDs.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 *  - tc.c Timer XMEGA Timer Counter driver implementation
 *  - tc.h Timer XMEGA Timer Counter driver definitions
 *  - tc_example1.c example application
 *  - conf_example.h: configuration of the example
 *
 * \section driverinfo TC Driver
 * The XMEGA TC driver can be found \ref tc_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices with an tc can be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The example will configure one TC module (\ref TIMER_EXAMPLE) in normal mode
 * and use three TC interrupts (overflow, Capture/Compare Channels A and B).
 *
 * The TC is setup to use a 31250Hz resolution clock and a 31250000 period value
 * resulting in a 1kHz TC overflow frequency.
 * Compare Channels A and B will be setup at 1/4 and 1/2 of the TC period.
 *
 * Each callback interrupts functions are setup to toggle a LED.
 *  - PORTA0 GPIO: Toggles on TC overflow interrupt
 *  - PORTA1 GPIO and PORTA2 GPIO: Toggle on Compare Channel A and B interrupts
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
