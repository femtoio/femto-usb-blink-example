 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use XMEGA E XCL module with LUT sub-module.
 * It performs a logic XOR operation between the 2 external input pins.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - xcl_example1.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 *
 * \section xcl_apiinfo drivers/XCL API
 * The XCL driver API can be found \ref xcl_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA E devices can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:
 *   - STK600 with ATxmega32E5 on STK600-RC032X
 *     LED0 pin should be connected to PD4 pin
 *     SW0 pin should be connected to PD2 pin
 *     SW1 pin should be connected to PD0 pin
 *   - XMEGA E5 Xplained evaluation kit
 *     No configuration required, SW0 and SW1 are already connected
 *     on PD0 and PD2, and LED0 on PD4.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description
 * This example configures XCL LUT0 sub-module to perform a logic XOR operation
 * between its two inputs pins IN0/IN1 map on the low nible of PORTD
 * (respectively PD2, PD0). The LUTO output pin is mapped to PORTD pin 4.
 * As this XCL configuration is purely asynchronous, the example enters Power
 * Down sleep mode, but the XOR operation between the two pins is still
 * functionnal.
 *
 * As a result, LED0 will light when only one SW0 or SW1 push button is pressed.
