/*! \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use XMEGA E XCL module with TC.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - xcl_example2.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 * - conf_xcl.h: XCL driver configuration (to enable ISR handling)
 *
 * \section xcl_apiinfo drivers/XCL API
 * The XCL driver API can be found \ref xcl_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA E devices can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:
 *   - STK600 with ATxmega32E5 on STK600-RC032X
 *     LED0 pin should be connected to PA0 pin
 *   - XMEGA E5 Xplained evaluation kit
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * This example will configure the XCL Timer sub-module in a 16bit timer with
 * its underflow interrupt to toggle a LED at 4Hz.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section contactinfo Contact Information
