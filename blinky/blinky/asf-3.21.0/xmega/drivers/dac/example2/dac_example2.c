 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates use of the \ref dac_group for dual-channel output
 * with automatic refresh.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - dac_example2.c: DAC driver example application
 * - conf_board.h: board initialization configuration
 * - conf_example.h: example application configuration
 * - conf_clock.h: system clock configuration
 *
 * \section apiinfo DAC driver API
 * The DAC driver API can be found \ref dac_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices with a DAC can be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * This example sets up the configured DAC (\ref OUTPUT_DAC) to perform DA
 * conversions on both channels, with output to their respective pins,
 * every time it receives events in event channel 0. Timer/counter 0 on port C
 * is used to generate the events on overflow. This setup gives a constant
 * conversion rate.
 *
 * The main loop in the example waits for the DAC channels to get ready for new
 * data, then alternately feeds them with values that are 10% and 90% of maximum
 * to demonstrate settling and hold time of the DAC.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
