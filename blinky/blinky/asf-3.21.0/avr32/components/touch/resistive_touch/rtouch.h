/**
 * \defgroup group_avr32_components_touch_resistive_touch TOUCH - Resistive Touch
 *
 * This driver offers resistive touch measurements by using the on-chip ADC.
 * In addition it offers calibration and a callback function for the
 * application.
 *
 * To improve the overall results four ADC channels are used to measure the
 * touch position. That means the measurements are done from each direction of
 * the touch surface.
