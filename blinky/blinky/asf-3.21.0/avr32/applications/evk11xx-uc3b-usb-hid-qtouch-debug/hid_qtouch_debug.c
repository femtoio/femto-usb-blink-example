/**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * \par USB HID stub for embedded QTouch Library to QTouch Studio communication
 *
 * This application is a USART<->USB gateway dedicated for trace messages
 * between the embedded QTouch library and QTouch Studio. It is meant to run
 * on a UC3B device connected through a UART to another device running the
 * QTouch Library and connected through USB to a computer running QTouch Studio.
 *
 * \par Usage
 *
 * -# Set-up of the USB stack
 * -# Set-up of the HID generic USB class
 * -# Set-up of the UART connection
 * -# All messages received from USB (i.e. from QTouch Studio) are sent over the
 * UART to the QTouch Library.
 * -# All messages received from the QTouch Library (i.e. over the UART) are
 * sent through USB to QTouch Studio.
