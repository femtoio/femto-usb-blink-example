/*! \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 *  This program can be use to run two different application programs (program 1 and program 2) on the UC3B1256 present on
 *  most EVK board.

 *  The selection of the program is chosen according to the USB mode button state upon power-up.
 *
 *  - If the USB mode button is pressed, then program 2 will be executed
 *  - Else program 1 will be executed
 *
 *  The boot selector program is located from 0x80002000 to 0x80002FFF. You must take care of
 *    keeping the USB DFU bootloader on the AT32UC3B, otherwise this application will not work.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 *    The Program 1 must start at address 0x80003000 and must not exceed 122KBytes.
 *    Update linker script to force linker to build at this address :

 *       - FLASH (rxai!w) :  ORIGIN = 0x80003000, LENGTH = 0x0001E800

 *    The Program 2 must start at address 0x80021800 and must not exceed 122KBytes.
 *     update linker script to force linker to build at this address :

 *       - FLASH (rxai!w) :  ORIGIN = 0x80021800, LENGTH = 0x0001E800
 *
 *   There are predefined linker scripts files present in the /linker_script
 *   folder of the present application:
 *
 *   - linker_scripts\gcc\link_uc3b1256_prog1.lds, for PROGRAM1_START_ADDRESS under gcc.
 *   - linker_scripts\gcc\link_uc3b1256_prog2.lds, for PROGRAM2_START_ADDRESS under gcc.
 *   - linker_scripts\iar\lnkuc3b1256_prog1.xcl, for PROGRAM1_START_ADDRESS under iar.
 *   - linker_scripts\iar\lnkuc3b1256_prog2.xcl, for PROGRAM2_START_ADDRESS under iar.
