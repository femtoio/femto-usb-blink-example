 * \brief EVK1100 Control Panel Default menu presentation.
 *
 * The Control Panel application is a demonstration application. Its purpose is
 * to automatically log local sensors and actuators data and events and make
 * these available through the various connectivity channels supported by the
 * AVR32.\n
 * The logs are accessible locally through USART or USB (Mass Storage class),
 * and/or remotely through the Internet (Web server).\n
 * The Control Panel is locally configurable through USART or USB (Mass Storage
 * class) or remotely configurable through the Internet (Web server).
 *
 * - OS:                 FreeRTOS port on AVR32 UC3.
 * - Boards:             EVK1100

/*! \page DefaultMenu Using the Control Panel LCD's default menu
 * In this scenario, you are a local user who accesses the Control Panel through
 * its on-board MMI interface.
 *
 * \section DefaultMenuAvail Default menu availability and purpose
 * The default menu is available just after reset or while there is no USB device
 * nor host device plugged to the EVK1100 board. This menu offers three actions:
 * - switch the Control Panel to USB key mode (<b><i>"Set as USB key"</i></b>),
 * - format the file system on the DataFlash(<b><i>"Format a:(DF)"</i></b>),
 * - create the LOG directory in the file system of the DataFlash(<b><i>"Create a:/LOG"</i></b>),
 * - set the logs to be stored to the DataFlash(<b><i>"Log to a:(DF)"</i></b>),
 * - format the file system on the SD/MMC card(<b><i>"Format b:(SDMMC)"</i></b>),
 * - create the LOG directory in the file system of the SD/MMC card(<b><i>"Create b:/LOG"</i></b>),
 * - set the logs to be stored to the SD/MMC card(<b><i>"Log to b:(SDMMC)"</i></b>)\n
 *
 * The menu organization is the following: \n
 * <b><i>Set as USB key > < Format a:(DF) > < Create a:/LOG > < Log to a:(DF) > < Format b:(SDMMC) > < Create b:/LOG > < Log to b:(SDMMC)</i></b>
 *
 * \note <b><i>a</i></b> is the drive letter associated with the DataFlash memory. \n <b><i>b</i></b> is the drive letter associated with the SD/MMC card memory.
 *

 *
 * \section SwitchToUsbKey Set as USB key
 * Press the joystick to switch the Control Panel to behave as a USB key. For a
 * step-by-step description of this mode see the \ref UsbCpMassStorageDevice scenario.
 * \note Note the right arrow on the last column of the third line : this means
 * that there is another menu item that is reachable with a right-stroke on the joystick.
 *
 * \section Formata Format a:(DF) or Format b:(SDMMC)
 * Press the joystick to perform a format of the selected memory filesystem.
 * \n
 * \image html FormatScreen.gif "LCD screen display example to format the filesystem on the DataFlash"
 * \n
 * The menu line will display a message while it is performing the requested action.
 * \n
 * \image html FormatingScreen.gif "LCD screen display example while formatting the filesystem on the DataFlash"
 * \n
 * Another way to perform the format of a: is through the shell command <i>"format a:"</i>; same for the SDMMC memory (replace a: with b:)
 * (see the \ref ShellUsage scenario for details on the Shell command line interface).
 * \note Note the left arrow on the first column of the third line : the previous
 * action is reachable by giving a left stroke to the joystick. Note the right arrow
 * on the last column of the third line : this means that there is another menu
 * that is reachable by giving a right-stroke to the joystick.
 *
 * \section CreateLog Create a:/LOG or Create b:/LOG
 * Press the joystick to create the /LOG directory to the required memory.
 * Once this directory exists, the Control Panel will create log files there.
 * \n
 * \image html CreateLogScreen.gif LCD screen display example to create the LOG directory on the DataFlash
 * \n
 * The menu line will display a message while it is performing the requested action.
 * \n
 * \image html CreatingLogScreen.gif LCD screen display example while the LOG directory is being created on the DataFlash
 * \n
 * \note The action is done so fast that you may not see that screen.
 *
 * Another way to create the LOG directory is through the <i>mkdir</i> shell
 * command (see the \ref ShellUsage scenario for details on the Shell command line
 * interface).
 * \note Note the left arrow on the first column of the third line : the previous
 * action is reachable by giving a left stroke to the joystick.
 *
 * \section LogToDst Log to a:(DF) or Log to b:(SDMMC)
 * \n
 * \image html LogToA.gif Press the joystick to store the logs to the DataFlash
 * \image html LogToB.gif Press the joystick to store the logs to the SD/MMC card
