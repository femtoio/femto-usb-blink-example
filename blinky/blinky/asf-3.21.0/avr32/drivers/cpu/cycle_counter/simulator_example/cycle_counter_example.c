/**

 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * This document gives an example of the usage of the CPU Cycle counter. The
 * cycle counter is a COUNT register, that increments once every clock. The
 * count register can be used together with the COMPARE register to create a
 * timer with interrupt functionality. The COMPARE register holds a value that
 * the COUNT register is compared against. When the COMPARE and COUNT registers
 * match, a compare interrupt request is generated and COUNT is reset to 0.
 *
 * \section example-description Example Description
 * This example shows how to use the COUNT register together with the COMPARE
 * register to generate an interrupt periodically.
 * Here is the operating mode of the example:
 * - At the beginning of the code, we check that initial default values of the
 * COUNT and COMPARE registers are correct.
 * - Then, COMPARE register is loaded with a delay specified by
 * delay_clock_cycles. This delay is (1 / fCPU) * delay_clock_cycles.
 * - Then the program infinitely loops, using the COUNT and COMPARE interrupt
 * with the above delay. Upon each COUNT and COMPARE match, GPIO line is
 * toggled.
