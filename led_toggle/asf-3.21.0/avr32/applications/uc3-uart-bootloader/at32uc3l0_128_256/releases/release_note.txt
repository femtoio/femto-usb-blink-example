Release Note - AVR UC3 UART DFU ISP
___________________________________


Related deliverables:
--------------------
- this release note,
- the AVR UC3 UART Bootloader user guide,
- a binary of the bootloader (at32uc3l-uart-isp-x.y.z.bin) and a default
  configuration bin file (at32uc3l-uart-isp_cfg-x.y.z.dat) with two scripts to
  program them to UC3L (program_at32uc3l-uart-isp-x.y.z.cmd to use on a DOS
  command line and program_at32uc3l-uart-isp-x.y.z.sh to use on a unix-like
  command line).
- the ASF: bootloader source code and helper files to be
  used by applications destined to be programmed through the bootloader.

1. Release History
__________________

Version 1.0.2 - 2011/04/28
--------------------------
 - First release

  Supported Devices:
  ------------------
  - AVR UC3 L0128 and L0256 revB and higher

  Devices delivered with version 1.0.2:
  ------------------------------------
  - AVR UC3 L0128 and L0256 revB or higher

  Features:
  --------
  - same feature set as the USB DFU Bootloaders:
    – Read/Write Flash on-Chip Memories
    – Read Device ID
    – Full-Chip Erase
    – Start Application Command
  - the last two words of the Flash user page are reserved for the bootloader
  - one baudrate supported: 115200 bps
  - Automatic detection of the UART used to communicate with the external programmer.
    This detection is performed over a pre-defined set of (USART_RX, USART_TX) pairs:
    USART0: (PA01, PA00)
    USART1: (PA04, PA05)
    USART2: (PA07, PA06)
    USART3: (PB01, PB00)
    Refer also to the AVR UC3 UART bootloader datasheet for the definition of the
    pre-defined set of (USART_RX, USART_TX) pairs per UC3 devices. 
  - AVR UC3 L0: No external oscillator required

  Known Bugs and Limitations:
  --------------------------
  - None

  Supported Tools:
  ---------------
  - AVR32 GNU Toolchain v3.2.0
  - FLIP::batchisp 3.4.3

  Footprint information:
  ---------------------
  Note: any build with Flash footprint over 8192Bytes is not usable (because the
  bootloader is meant to fit in 8kB).
  - Built with IAR EW AVR32: N.A.
  - Built with GCC: 7612 Bytes
