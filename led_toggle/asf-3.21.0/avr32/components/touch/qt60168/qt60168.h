/**
 * \defgroup group_avr32_components_touch_qt60168 TOUCH - QT60168 16-key QMatrix touch sensor
 *
 * This driver offers configuration as well as checking the status of the touch sensor.
 * The driver uses the TWI to communicate with the sensor and GPIO as a status change input from the sensor.
 * It is possible to add a callback function from the application and this will be executed each time
 * a change has been detected in the sensor state.
