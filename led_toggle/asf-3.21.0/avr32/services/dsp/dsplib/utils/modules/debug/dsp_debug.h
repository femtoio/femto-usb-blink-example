/*! \anchor Printf
 * \name Printf functions
 * \brief These function permits to print any data on a printing device.\n
 * These functions work as the printf function, except that they include the fixed point Q formatted format notion.
 * The following attributes are currently implemented:\n
 * \li \b s : The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).
 * Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\\0'); if a precision is specified,
 * no more than the number specified are written. If a precision is given, no null byte need be present; if the precision is not
 * specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.\n
 * \li \b d ,\b i : The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear;
 * if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1.
 * When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.\n
 * \li \b o ,\b u ,\b x ,\b X : The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (\b o ), unsigned decimal (\b u ), or unsigned hexadecimal (\b x and \b X ) notation.
 * The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions. The precision, if any,
 * gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.
 * The default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.\n
 * \li \b c : The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.\n
 * \li \b f : The fixed point argument is converted to decimal notation in the style [-]ddd.ddd, [THE FOLLOWING IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!] where the number of digits after the decimal-point character
 * is equal to the precision specification. If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is explicitly zero, no decimal-point character appears.
 * If a decimal point appears, at least one digit appears before it.
