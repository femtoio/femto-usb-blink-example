/*! \brief This is the function called by ushell_task() to perform all the MP3
 *         decoding.
 *
 *  \return false in case of error, otherwise return true.
 *
 * It instantiates a decoder object and configures it with the input, output,
 * and error callback functions above. A single call to mad_decoder_run()
 * continues until a callback function returns MAD_FLOW_STOP (to stop decoding)
 * or MAD_FLOW_BREAK (to stop decoding and signal an error).
