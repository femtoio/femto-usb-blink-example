 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref pwm_group to dim LEDs.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - pwm.c PWM service implementation
 * - pwm.h PWM service definitions
 * - example1.c example application
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * This example is made specifically for XMEGA-A1 Xplained. However, any XMEGA
 * board with LEDs connected to PE0-PE6 may be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * This example sets up 4 PWM channels and outputs them to 4 different LEDs,
 * giving the impression the LEDs are dimmed.
 * All 4 PWM channels are set up with the same frequency, but uses different
 * duty cycles to give different level of dimming.
 * LED3 is set up to light constantly (since the LEDs are active low, this
 * means 0% duty cycle)
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following module:
 * - \ref pwm_group
 *
 * \section apiinfo PWM Service API
 * The PWM service API can be found \ref pwm_group "here"
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
 *
 * \section contactinfo Contact Information
