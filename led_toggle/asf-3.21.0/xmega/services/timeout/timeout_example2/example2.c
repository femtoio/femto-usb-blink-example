 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to setup a debounce filter on a button
 * using the the \ref timeout_group.
 *
 * \section files Main files
 *
 * - example2.c:     The example application
 * - timeout.c:      The XMEGA timeout service implementation
 * - timeout.h:      The XMEGA timeout service API definition
 * - conf_timeout.h  Configuration of the timeout service
 *
 * \section driverinfo Timeout service
 * The timeout service can be found \ref timeout_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All XMEGA devices with RTC or RTC32 can be used
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * This example will demonstrate the effect of a debounce filter on a push
 * button. Button0 includes the debounce filter and toggles LED0 when toggled.
 * Button1 will toggle LED1, but without the debounce filter causing a
 * jittering and unpredictable behaviour.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
