 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref tc_group to generate
 * single slope PWM.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 *  - tc.c Timer XMEGA Timer Counter driver implementation
 *  - tc.h Timer XMEGA Timer Counter driver definitions
 *  - tc_example2.c example application
 *  - conf_example.h: configuration of the example
 *
 * \section driverinfo TC Driver
 * The XMEGA TC driver can be found \ref tc_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices with an tc can be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The example uses and configures two TC modules.
 *  - \ref TIMER_PORT_LED is configured to generate single slope PWM on LED0
 *  - \ref TIMER_EXAMPLE is used in generate a 50ms overflow interrupt
 *
 * Each time the 50ms overflow interrupt of \ref TIMER_EXAMPLE is executed
 * the \ref TIMER_PORT_LED single slope PWM duty cycle is changed so that it
 * result visible on LEDO light intensity.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
