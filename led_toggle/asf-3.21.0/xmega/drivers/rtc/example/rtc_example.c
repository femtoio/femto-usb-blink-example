/**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref rtc_group.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - rtc.c RTC driver implementation
 * - rtc.h RTC driver definitions
 * - rtc_example.c example application
 * - conf_rtc.h RTC driver configurations
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices with a RTC can be used. This example have been
 * tested with the following setup:
 * - Xplain
 * - XMEGA A1 Xplained
 * - ATxmega32D4 using STK600-RC044x
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 * The example will initalize the RTC and use the xplain LEDS or the STK600 PORTA
 * to show the last two digits from time in binary coded decimal (BCD).
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following modules:
 * - \ref rtc_group
 * - \ref gpio_group for LED output
 * - \ref pmic_group for interrupt handling
 * - \ref sleepmgr_group for sleep management
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
 *
