/*! \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use XMEGA E USART module with Start Frame
 * Detection.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - usart_example2.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 * - conf_usart_example.h: configuration of the example
 *
 * \section usart_apiinfo drivers/usart API XMEGA E specific
 * The USART XMEGA E specific driver extension can be found
 * \ref usart_xmegae_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:
 *   - STK600 with ATxmega32E5 on STK600-RC032X
 *     USARTC0 on PC2 and PC3 pins should be connected to the RXD and TXD
 *     pins of STK600 RS232 spare port.
 *   - XMEGA E5 Xplained evaluation kit
 *     USARTD0 on PORTD pin 6 and 7 is used (Connected to board controller)
 * UART configuration is 115200 baudrate, no parity, data 8 bit.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The example waits for a received character on the configured USART and
 * echoes the character back to the same USART. When waiting for a character,
 * the cpu core enters standby mode and is wake up using the start frame
 * detection on USART.
 * Using the internal 8MHz Oscilator of ATxmega32E5, the wakeup character is not
 * lost.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
