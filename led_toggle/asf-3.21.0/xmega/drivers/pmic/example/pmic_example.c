 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows elementary use of the \ref pmic_group and
 * \ref interrupt_group.
 * It demonstrates:
 * - definition of Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)
 * - enabling of individual interrupt levels
 * - global enabling of interrupts
 * - interruptability of lower interrupt levels
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - pmic_example.c: PMIC and interrupt example application
 * - conf_example.h: configuration of I/O pins
 *
 * \section apiinfo PMIC and interrupt APIs
 * The PMIC API can be found \ref pmic_group "here".
 * The interrupt API can be found \ref interrupt_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices with a type 0 timer/counter on port C can be used.
 * The example has been tested on the following boards:
 * - Xplain
 * - XMEGA A1 Xplained
 * - XMEGA A3BU Xplained
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * Six I/O pins and a timer/counter (TCC0) are used in this example.
 * Three of the I/O pins (\ref LED_PIN_0 , \ref LED_PIN_1 , \ref LED_PIN_2) are
 * used to control on-board LEDs, while the rest (\ref BUTTON_PIN_0 ,
 * \ref BUTTON_PIN_1 , \ref BUTTON_PIN_2) are used for input from on-board
 * buttons (active low).
 *
 * The timer/counter is run in normal waveform generation mode, with the compare
 * channels A and B enabled. The interrupts for the compare channels, and the
 * timer/counter overflow are configured with LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH levels,
 * respectively. These interrupts will trigger in sequence, and their service
 * routines (ISR) toggle their respective LEDs on and off.
 *
 * To prevent the ISRs from returning, the user can press and hold the button
 * that corresponds to an ISR's LED, e.g., \ref BUTTON_PIN_0 for \ref LED_PIN_0.
 * The ISRs for interrupts of higher level will still execute in this case,
 * causing only the LEDs with higher pin number to toggle. Once the button is
 * released, the ISR will return and pending interrupts be handled.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
