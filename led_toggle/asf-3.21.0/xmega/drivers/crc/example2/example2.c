 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref crc_group on FLASH memory.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - crc.c CRC driver implementation
 * - crc.h CRC driver definitions
 * - example2.c example application
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA AU devices with a CRC module can be used. This example have
 * been tested with the following setup:
 * - XMEGA-A3BU Xplained
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 * The example will setup the CRC module and generate CRC-32 for a range of
 * flash memory, then read the range of flash memory, append the calculated
 * checksum and use the I/O interface to calculate the checksum again to make
 * sure it is zero.
 * The example will then generate CRC for the boot section and the application
 * section and compare the checksum values with the checksums for the same
 * sections generated by flash range CRC.
 * For each successful CRC comparison, a message will be written to the screen.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following modules:
 * - \ref crc_group
 * - \ref nvm_group
 * - \ref gfx_mono
 * - \ref gfx_mono_font
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
