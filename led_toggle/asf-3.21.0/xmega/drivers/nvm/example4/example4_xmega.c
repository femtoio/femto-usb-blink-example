 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to use the
 * \ref nvm_fuse_lock_group "NVM fuse and lock bits handling" of the
 * \ref nvm_group.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - example4_xmega.c example application
 * - conf_example.h example configuration
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices can be used. This example have
 * been tested with the following setup:
 * - Xplain * - XMEGA A1 Xplained
 * - XMEGA A3BU Xplained
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 *
 * The example uses the \ref nvm_fuse_lock_group
 * "NVM fuse and lock bits driver" to read a fuse (FUSEBYTE2).
 * The BOOTRST bit (Boot Loader Section Reset Vector) in this fuse is then
 * checked, and if it is set to "Reset Vector = Application Reset" LED1 is
 * toggled. If it isn't set, the LED will not toggle. The user can set the
 * reset vector to Application Reset with an appropriate fuse programmer.
 *
 * This example also demonstrates how to write different lock bits. It is
 * recommended to perform a chip erase after running this example to make
 * sure all lock bits are cleared.
 *
 * LED 0 is toggled when the execution of this example is starting.
 * LED 2 is toggled to indicate the reset vector is pointing to application flash section.
 * For the Xplain, LED 7 is toggled when the execution of this example has ended.
 * For the A3BU Xplained, the status LED is toggled when the execution has ended.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following modules:
 * - \ref gpio_group for LED output.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
 *
 * \section contactinfo Contact Information
