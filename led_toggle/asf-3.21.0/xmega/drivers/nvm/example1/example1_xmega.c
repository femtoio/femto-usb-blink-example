 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to use the
 * \ref nvm_signature_group "NVM signature handling" of the \ref nvm_group.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - example1_xmega.c example application
 * - conf_example.h example configuration
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices can be used. This example have
 * been tested with the following setup:
 * - Xplain * - XMEGA A1 Xplained
 * - XMEGA A3BU Xplained
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 *
 * The example uses the \ref nvm_signature_group "NVM signature driver" to
 * read the device signature and the production signature and outputs the
 * status on the Xplain LEDs:
 * - LED0: Signature byte read from device matches the compiled test program
 * - LED1: Production signature row has been read, and contains data
 * - LED7: Test completed
 * On the A3BU Xplained, test completed is shown by the status LED being green.
 *
 * If either LED0 or LED1 does not light up, this indicates a failure on these
 * tests.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following modules:
 * - \ref gpio_group for LED output
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
 *
