 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref tc45_group to generate
 * single slope PWM.
 *
 * The example uses and configures two TC modules.
 *  - TCD5 is configured to generate single slope PWM on LED0
 *  - TCC4 is used in generate a 50ms overflow interrupt
 *
 * Each time the 50ms overflow interrupt of TCC4 is executed
 * the TCD5 single slope PWM duty cycle is changed so that it
 * result visible on LEDO light intensity.
 *
 * \note
 * All AVR XMEGA E devices can be used.
 * The TC45 driver API can be found \ref tc45_group "here".
 *
 * Main files:
 *  - tc45.c Timer XMEGA Timer Counter driver implementation
 *  - tc45.h Timer XMEGA Timer Counter driver definitions
 *  - tc45_example2.c example application
 *
 * \section board_setup Board setup
 * For STK600 board:
 * - uses the RC032X routine board with TQFP32 socket
 * - PD4 must be connected to LED0
 *
 * For XMEGA-E5 Xplained board:
 * - plug USB for the power
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
