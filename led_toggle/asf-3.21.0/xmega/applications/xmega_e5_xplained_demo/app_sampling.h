 * The schedule and the ADC conversions are done only by interrupt
 * (RTC and ADC) to guarantee a constant acquisition. The FIFO service
 * is used to save value, thus the sampling task can read FIFO, send values
 * through UART and display values without timing constraint.
 * The implementation is available in app_sampling.c/.h files.
