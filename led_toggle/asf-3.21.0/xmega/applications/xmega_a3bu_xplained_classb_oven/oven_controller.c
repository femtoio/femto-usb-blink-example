 * The oven has three states:
 *    - POWER_OFF where we just wait for input from the user interface to turn

 *    - ON_NO_POT where the user has indicated that power should be applied, but

 *    - ON_ACTUATING where we have a pot on the oven, and actuate the induction
 *      elements while waiting for user input, and check if there is a pot on
 *      the oven.
 *
 * \param time Current system time in milliseconds.
 * \param *wattage Pointer to the variable representing the desired effect
