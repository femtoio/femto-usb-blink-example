/**
 * \defgroup classb_wdt Watchdog Timer Test
 *
 * \brief Test to check that the watchdog timer (WDT) is working.
 *
 * The WDT is a system function for monitoring correct program operation that
 * allows recovering from error situations such as runaway or deadlocked code.
 * The self-diagnostic test \ref classb_wdt_test() is executed before the main
 * application and it basically makes sure that:
 * - a system reset is issued after WDT timeout
 * - the WDT can be reset
 * - the device is reset upon untimely WDT reset in window mode
 *
 * The test relies on the Real Time Counter (RTC) to check the timing of the WDT
 * oscillator and, therefore, this library includes a basic RTC driver (see
 * \ref rtc_driver). Note that the RTC has a clock source independent from the
 * CPU and the WDT. The RTC module is implicitly tested as well: if the
 * frequency difference between RTC and WDT is more than 50%, the error state is
 * set.
 *
 * Errors are handled by \ref CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_WDT() and there are a number
 * of configurable actions:
 * -# \ref CLASSB_ACTIONS_1_WDT() sets up the WDT for the main application,
 * -# \ref CLASSB_ACTIONS_2_WDT() processes systems resets caused by a working
 * WDT.
 * -# \ref CLASSB_ACTIONS_3_WDT() deals with other reset causes, e.g. brown-out
 * or software reset.
 *
 * In addition to the error handler and configurable actions, the user should
 * configure the WDT periods \ref CLASSB_WDT_WPER and \ref CLASSB_WDT_PER.
 *
 * \note The WDT should be left enabled by this test and be active at all times.
 * There are a number of Class B tests that can potentially take longer time
 * than a WDT, see for example \ref classb_crc. If this is the case, a possible
 * solution would be to increase the WDT period before the Class B test and
 * decrease it afterwards.

 * The RTC frequency is set to 1024 Hz. Note that:
 * - if <tt>PER == 0</tt>, only one third of the interrupts are generated
 * - if <tt>PER == 1</tt>, only one half of the interrupts are generated
 * This is not handled by the code, but <tt>PER=2</tt> is small enough. That
 * means approximately 3ms (3 ticks/1024KHz): the value in PER is compared with
 * the counter value, which starts at 0, so the real period will be
 * <tt>CLASSB_WDT_RTC_PER+1</tt>.
