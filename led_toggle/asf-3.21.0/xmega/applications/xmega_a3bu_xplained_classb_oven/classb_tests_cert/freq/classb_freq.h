/**
 * \defgroup cpu_freq CPU Frequency Test
 *
 * \brief Self-diagnostic test for the CPU frequency.
 *
 * The test consists of monitoring the frequency of a Timer/Counter (TC) using
 * the Real Time Counter (RTC) module as a time reference. Note that the TC has
 * the same clock domain as the CPU and that the RTC module in XMEGA can have a
 * clock source independent from the CPU clock domain. Also, note that
 * \ref CLASSB_FREQ_TEST has to be defined. For more details see
 * \ref rtc_driver.
 *
 * The test is implemented as follows:
 * -# an RTC compare interrupt is scheduled periodically with
 * \ref classb_rtc_setup() and a TC is started with
 * \ref classb_freq_setup_timer().
 * -# the RTC interrupt calls \ref classb_freq_callback(), which compares the
 * absolute difference between the count in the TC and a predefined reference.
 * If it is greater than expected, the error handler
 * \ref CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_FREQ() is called.
 *
 * The TC overflow interrupt increases a counter that can be used as the most
 * significant word (bits 31 to 16) for the TC counter value. Further, there is
 * a configurable limit for the number of overflows. If this is exceeded, the
 * program assumes that the RTC is working correctly and the error handler
 * is called as well.
 *
 * The test is flexible and it is possible to choose some settings for the TC
 * and RTC. It is important to choose values for \ref CLASSB_RTC_INT_PERIOD,
 * \ref CLASSB_RTC_FREQ, \ref CLASSB_TC_PRESCALER and \ref CLASSB_TC_TOLERANCE
 * so that the frequency of the CPU \ref F_CPU is estimated reliably. Further,
 * there should not be an overflow in \ref CLASSB_TC_COUNT_REF. Suggested values
 * have been included in the documentation.
