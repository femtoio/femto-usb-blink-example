/**
 * \defgroup int_mon Interrupt Monitor
 *
 * \brief A test for the frequency of interrupts.
 *
 * Each time an interrupt is executed a counter is increased. The interrupt
 * monitor is executed periodically to check that the counters are within a
 * configurable range.
 * The Real Time Counter is used to run \ref classb_intmon_callback()
 * periodically. The Interrupt monitor is enabled after calling
 * \ref classb_rtc_setup(). Note that \ref CLASSB_INT_MON should be defined.
 * See \ref rtc_driver for more details.
 *
 * In order to monitor an interrupt, the following steps should be followed:
 * -# Register the interrupt in \ref classb_int_identifiers.
 * -# The main application registers the interrupt by calling
 * \ref classb_intmon_reg_int(). This gives the monitor information on the
 * interrupt, for example the expected frequency.
 * -# The interrupts that have to be monitored should call
 * \ref classb_intmon_increase() on each execution.
 * -# The main application requests that the monitor starts checking the
 * interrupt. This is done by changing the interrupt state to \c M_ENABLE with
 * \ref classb_intmon_set_state(). The next time the interrupt monitor runs the
 * state of the interrupt will be set to \c ON.
 * -# If at some point an interrupt should stop being monitored, the main
 * application can change the state to \c M_DISABLE. The interrupt monitor will
 * change the state to \c OFF the next time it is executed.
 *
 * The fact that the main application has to request to start monitoring an
 * interrupt (and that it is the monitor sets the \c ON state) ensures that the
 * interrupt counter is synchronized with the interrupt monitor, i.e. the
 * interrupt counter starts being increased exactly after a period of the
 * interrupt monitor.
 *
 * Note that the interrupt counter is only increased if the interrupt is \c ON.
 * When an interrupt is \c OFF, the counter should be zero and otherwise the
 * error flag will be set. Further, enabling an interrupt that is \c ON or
 * disabling an interrupt that is \c OFF will call the error handler if
 * \ref CLASSB_STRICT_INTMON is defined.
 *
 * The error handler related to this test is CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_INTERRUPT().
