/**
 * \defgroup classb_crc CRC Tests
 *
 * \brief This CRC module can be used to check the Flash and EEPROM memories.
 *
 * \section crc_intro Introduction to CRC
 *
 * A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error detection technique test
 * algorithm used to detect errors in data. It is commonly used to determine the
 * correctness of data stored in memory or data that is received through some
 * communication channel. The CRC algorithm takes a data stream or a block of
 * data as input and generates a 16- or 32-bit output that can be used as a
 * checksum. We suggest two possible methods to detect errors using this
 * checksum:
 *
 * -Compute checksum of the data section and compare with the previous one. If
 * they are different, there is an error.
 *
 * -Compute checksum of the extended data section (data section and original
 * checksum). The resulting checksum should be a fixed implementation-specific
 * value, otherwise there is an error.
 *
 * If there were errors in the data, the application should take corrective
 * actions, e.g., requesting the data to be sent again or simply not using the
 * incorrect data.
 *
 * The CRC Tests module implements 16-bit CCITT CRC and IEE802.3 32-bit CRC
 * algorithms in software and hardware:
 *  - \ref classb_crc_sw
 *  - \ref classb_crc_hw
 *
 * \section crc_usage Usage
 *
 * There are a number of symbols in \ref crc_conf that can be defined or
 * undefined in order to choose between software and hardware implementations,
 * and 16-bit and 32-bit CRC. The software implementation can be further
 * configured in the corresponding header file.
 *
 * To calculate an EEPROM checksum, use the functions
 *  - \c CLASSB_CRC[16/32]_EEPROM_[SW/HW]
 *
 * To calculate a Flash checksum, use the functions
 *  - \c CLASSB_CRC[16/32]_Flash_[SW/HW]
 *
 * If there are any errors, the error handler \ref CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_CRC() is
 * called.
 *
 * \note Interrupts must be disabled during this test.
 *
 * \section crc_speed Execution speed
 *
 * We provide an estimate for the execution speed of different CRC
 * implementations. Note that this is based on empirical results.
 * - EEPROM
 *     - CRC32 lookup table is ~45% slower than HW.
 *     - CRC32 direct calculation is ~750% slower than HW.
 *     - CRC16 lookup table is ~20% slower than HW.
 *     - CRC16 direct calculation is ~430% slower than HW.
 * - Flash
 *     - CRC32 lookup table is ~4600% slower than HW.
 *     - CRC32 direct calculation is ~15800% slower than HW.
 *     - CRC16 lookup table is ~3% slower than HW.
 *     - CRC16 direct calculation is ~275% slower than HW.

 * \brief Data types used in connection with CRC computations.
 *
 * This includes the type for variables that stores the data size in bytes,
 * memory addresses in Flash, and pointers to memory. Both for Flash and EEPROM
 * there are void pointer types and pointers to byte. Variables can be assigned
 * a memory attribute with IAR. Therefore, pointers will be large enough to hold
 * the address of a given variable. However, with GCC pointers have 16 bits.
 * This means that if a device has a large program  memory, we have to use
 * 32-bits variables to store Flash addresses.
