/**
 * \brief Define the current CPU clock speed based on device settings
 *
 * This define is used by e.g. the libc delay functions to calculate the correct
 * amount of cycles to busy wait for a given delay.
 *
 * \note This value needs to reflect the device fuse settings, that is it needs to
 * be the correct value for either the current internal RC setting or external
 * clock or crystal settings. Functions that rely on this define will not work
 * correctly with an incorrect value.
