 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref megarf_interrupt_group for
 * nested external interrupt
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - ext_int_example2.c: This example application
 * - conf_interrupt.h: configuration of the megaRF driver
 *
 * \section driverinfo Interrupt Driver
 * The interrupt driver can be found \ref megarf_interrupt_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * AVR MEGARF device can be used.
 *
 * \section setup Setup
 * External interrupt INT0 pin is enabled and user defined another external
 * interrupt source(example INT1) is also enabled.SW1 and SW2 are the switches
 * connected to the interrupt pins
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * switch SW1 is pressed, due to pull-up the
 * interrupt INT0 will be triggered only when SW1 is released and LED1 blinks
 * for some time. During the time while LED1 is glowing, a switch action on
 * another SW2 will trigger INT1 and hence the LED2 blinks for a moment and
 * goes off. This is because, inside the ISR of INT0, the I-bit is set so
 * that all other interrupts are activated. So even when the CPU is inside
 * the INT0 routine it senses the interrupt INT1 and jumps to the ISR of
 * INT1 and executes the routine and then jumps back to ISR of INT0.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
