/**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref megarf_interrupt_group for
 * external interrupt
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - ext_int_example1.c: This example application
 * - conf_interrupt.h: configuration of the megaRF driver
 * - conf_example.h example definitions
 *
 * \section driverinfo Interrupt Driver
 * The interrupt driver can be found \ref megarf_interrupt_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * AVR MEGARF device can be used. This example has been
 * tested with the following setup:
 *  - STK600 evaluation Kit (Tested with STK600-ATMEGA128RFA1)
 *  - ATmega256RFR2 Xplained Pro kit
 *
 * \section setup Setup
 * user defined External interrupt INTx pin is enabled
 * The on board switch connected to the external interrupt pin 
 * is used in this example
 *
 * \section example description Description of the example
 * when on board switch is pressed, interrupt INTx will be triggered
 * when switch is released and LED on the board will blinks once.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section contactinfo Contact Information
